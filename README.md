Makerble is a data platform that enables nonprofit organisations to measure their impact.
Surveys are one of the main methods used by nonprofits to measure their impact using the
Makerble platform. Makerble enables them to design, distribute and analyse surveys

HERE I PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING TASKS
1. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
   In this section i provided a summary of mean, median, mode and descriptive statistics for overall engagement and job satisfaction.

   Identified any key trends in the survey results. For example:
   Are employees in a certain age bracket or department more satisfied than
   others?
   Does any demographic group (age, gender, ethnicity) show patterns in
   certain areas (e.g., Work-Life Balance or Compensation Satisfaction)?
2. INFERENTIAL STATISTICS:
   Conducted a hypothesis test to see if there's a statistically significant difference in
   Job Satisfaction between two specific departments (e.g. IT and HR). Stated
   null hypothesis, test method (e.g., t-test), and explained results.
   
   Performed a correlation analysis to determine if there is any relationship between
   Work-Life Balance and Overall Engagement. Interpreted the correlation coefficient
   and explain what it means in the context of employee experience.
 3. PRESENTATION:
   CreateD a presentation explaining  analysis, results, and key takeaways.

   Discussed  business implications or recommendations to the
   fictional nonprofit based on my findings. For example:
    What areas of employee experience need improvement?
    Are there any differences in experience across departments or
   demographics that the organisation should address?
